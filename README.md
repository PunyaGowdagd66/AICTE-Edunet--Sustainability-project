#  AICTE Edunet Foundation Internship Project  
### Project Title: Air Quality Prediction for Sustainable Smart Cities  
### Student Name:Punya Gowda G D  
### City: Bengaluru  

##  Project Description  
This project focuses on predicting *air quality levels* in Bengaluru using *Artificial Intelligence (AI)* and *Machine Learning (ML)* techniques.  
It helps identify pollution levels and supports sustainable urban development by improving air quality awareness.

##  Objective  
- To analyze air pollution data of Bengaluru city.  
- To predict PM2.5 and PM10 air quality levels.  
- To promote sustainable cities through environmental data analysis.

##  Tools & Technologies  
- *Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)*  
- *Google Colab* for coding and training the model  
- *Dataset:* Air Quality Data (India 2015–2020)  

##  Outcome  
The trained AI model predicts air quality based on input parameters and helps track pollution trends.  
This project supports *UN Sustainable Development Goal 13 – Climate Action*.
