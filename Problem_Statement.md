# Problem Statement – AICTE Edunet Foundation Internship

### Project Title: Air Quality Prediction for Sustainable Smart Cities  
Intern Name: Punya Gowda G D  
Domain: Artificial Intelligence – Sustainability  
City Used:Bengaluru

##  Problem Statement:
The increasing air pollution in Indian cities poses serious health and environmental challenges.  
This project uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to predict *PM2.5 air quality levels* using real-world data from Kaggle.  
The aim is to create awareness and provide early warnings to support *cleaner, sustainable cities* in line with the *United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 13 (Climate Action)*.

## Objectives:
- Collect and analyze air quality data for Bengaluru city.  
- Train an AI model to predict PM2.5 concentration levels.  
- Classify the air quality into Good / Moderate / Unhealthy categories.  
- Support environmental sustainability through data-driven insights.
  
##  Tools and Technologies:
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)  
- Google Colab  
- Kaggle Dataset  
- GitHub Repository for project submission

##  Expected Outcome:
The AI model will predict daily PM2.5 levels accurately and help visualize air pollution trends, promoting *smart and sustainable city planning*.
